            <h1>Black Panther</h1>
            <p>
              Black Panther is a fictional character appearing in American comic books
              published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer-editor
              Stan Lee and artist-coplotter Jack Kirby. The character first appeared
              in Fantastic Four #52 (cover-dated July 1966) in the Silver Age of Comic
              Books. Black Panther's real name is T'Challa, and he is depicted as the
              king and protector of the fictional African nation of Wakanda. Along
              with possessing enhanced abilities achieved through ancient Wakandan
              rituals of drinking the essence of the heart-shaped herb, T'Challa also
              relies on his proficiency in science, rigorous physical training,
              hand-to-hand combat skills, and access to wealth and advanced Wakandan
              technology to combat his enemies.

      <h2>Origin and early stories</h2>
      <p>
        Seeking to address the dearth of Black characters in comics, Lee and
        Kirby created T’Challa, a member of the royal family of the fictional
        African country of Wakanda. Wakanda was depicted as a peculiar mix of
        futuristic technology and traditional life, a dichotomy produced by the
        presence in the country of Vibranium, a rare and nearly indestructible
        meteoric ore. After the death of his father at the hands of the
        villainous Ulysses Klaw, T’Challa claimed the throne as well as the
        mantle of the Black Panther. Upon becoming the Black Panther, T’Challa
        was exposed to a mystical herb that enhanced his strength and agility to
        near-superhuman levels. After meeting the Fantastic Four, T’Challa
        decided his powers would be put to best use in the service of all
        humanity, although Wakanda traditionally had been closed to the outside
        world, and so he flew off to New York, leaving his people behind.

        The Black Panther joined the Avengers in 1968, where he became a
        mainstay for the next several years. Although the character predated the
        revolutionary political organization of the same name, Marvel briefly
        changed the Black Panther’s name to the Black Leopard in an attempt to
        dissociate the two. A short time later he was back to being the Black
        Panther again, and in 1973 he headlined his own book for the first time.
        The “Panther’s Rage” story arc ran for two years in Jungle Action, a
        series written by Don McGregor and drawn for the most part by the
        African American artist Billy Graham. Reflecting the times’ interest in
        African roots and Black consciousness in general, the strip returned
        T’Challa to a Wakanda riven by infighting and sedition, where he managed
        to balance superheroics with musings on colonialism and democracy. For
        the duration of the tale, the strip featured an all-Black cast,
        something that had never before been attempted in mainstream superhero
        comics, and the innovations continued in a later story, which saw the
        Panther take on the Ku Klux Klan.
        <p>Poor sales prompted Marvel to cancel Jungle Action before the Klan story
             was finished, and it was replaced in 1977 with a new Black Panther title by Jack
              Kirby. This new direction was as far from the gritty realism of McGregor’s tales
               as it is possible to imagine, as it featured a time-traveling frog statue said
                to belong to King Solomon, the Yeti, and a group of Wakandan nobles known as the
                 Black Musketeers. This title too was short-lived. Sporadic appearances over the
                  next two decades kept the Black Panther in the Marvel firmament, but he was 
                  increasingly marginalized. Miniseries in 1988 and 1991 were solid, if unspectacular,
                  attempts at revitalizing what was effectively a lapsed franchise. The first tackled
                   apartheid, and the second dealt with the Panther’s search for his mother, but neither led to 
                   anything substantial. With Black characters no longer a comics novelty and with role
                    models such as the characters of Milestone Comics—which had more relevance to their 
                    readers than a wealthy African king—it seemed as if the Panther’s time had passed.</p>
